*[mg/dL]: milligrams per deciliter
*[mmol/L]:  millimoles per liter
# Blood Glucose
Blood glucose is a measure of how much glucose is in your blood.
This is typically measured in *mg/dL* and *mmol/L*.
The units you use for glucose measurements will vary depending on which country you live in.

# Conversions
Converting between mg/dL and mmol/L can be done by dividing or multiplying by a factor of $18$.

* To convert mg/dL -> mmol/L: divide the reading by $18$
* To convert mmol/L -> mg/dL: multiply the reading by $18$

# Exact Conversions
> This is cool, extra info if you want to know the intricate details of the glucose unit conversion factor. **_This will not affect your diabetes management at all, so it is entirely educational._**
{.is-warning}


The conversion factor of $18$ given in the [conversions section above](#conversions) is not as precise as it can be.
This preciseness was traded for ease of understanding as it's not necessary for the average person to use the exact conversion factor in everyday glucose conversions.

## Why don't we use the precise conversion factor for most calculations?

The percentage difference between the simplified factor ($18$) and the exact/precise factor ($18.0156$) is $0.0866291\%$, which is an extremely negligible loss in precision.
In most cases, someone who needs to convert a blood glucose value will not be dealing with such a large value that the precision loss with the simplified factor would be critical.
As the blood glucose value you're converting from increases, the difference between the simplified and precise factors increases linearly.

You can use [this Desmos calculator](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/7ct6n1ufwq) to see for yourself.
It's difficult to see the actual difference on your screen, but if you click and drag on the line you can see the Y value (difference between the two conversion factors) increasing slowly with the X value (blood glucose in mg/dL).

## What circumstances would you use the precise conversion factor in?

The main usage for the precise conversion factor would be in calculators.
As stated in the previous answer, most people will not be dealing with large glucose values that results in a noticeable drift between the simplified and precise factors (as the value gets larger, so does the difference between the simplified and exact factors), but calculators may encounter these large values that can make a noticeable difference in the resulting value.
In addition, the calculator may need to perform further calculations using the result (for example, estimating the [HbA1c]()) which means having the result as precise as possible will help ensure calculations are as accurate as they can be.
