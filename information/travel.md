# Traveling with Diabetes
![airplane.png](/airplane.png)

Travel with Diabetes can be daunting at first. Making sure your bag is packed with all of the necessary equipment and medication is only the beginning of the adventure.

## Packing your Supplies and Medications
Make sure to bring enough of the medication and supplies you need to last one-and-a-half to two times the length of your travel plans. It is difficult to get replacement supplies and medications when you are traveling abroad, so it is best to have extra stuff just in case.

When packing for your trip, you may be aware of the rule that all of your liquids must fit in one quart-sized ziploc bag. For travelers with medical conditions, you are allowed to bring another bag (or more if need be) to carry your medical liquids. They do not count towards your allotted one quart sized bag of liquids.

All aboard! When traveling, make sure to pack your medications and supplies _in your carryon luggage_. It is the least likely article to get lost, and, if you have it in your checked baggage, and it gets lost... not a good start to your adventure, my friends.

## The Security Line
The security line has many pitfalls you can avoid with the proper preparation. We will help out by giving a few tips that have helped us in the past.

### Give Yourself Time
Make sure you give yourself at least double the recommended time to get through the security checkpoint than you usually would. For example, often it is best to arrive to an international flight 2 hours before the flight departs instead of one hour. Worst case scenario you are early for your flight and get to hang out at the airport for a bit before your flight departs. It is much better to have too much time left over than missing your flight due to delays at the security line.

### Medications
As stated above, your prescription liquids do not count against your 1 quart ziploc bag of liquids limit, so keep them in a separate plastic bag. Place liquids, pills, etc. in an x-ray scan bin next to your other bag full of liquids, deodorant, hairspray/gels, etc. if you have one. Make sure your prescription medications have a prescription label with the medication name and your name on the side. This will prevent the TSA from accusing you of smuggling prescription drugs across the border.

### Devices
TSA has specific procedures for people with medical devices. You are able to bypass the milimeter wave x-ray scanner, as well as keep any insulin pump, CGM, or omnipods attached while walking through the metal detector. All you need to do is state that you are a passenger with non-removable medical devices and wish to opt for a patdown instead of going into the millimeter wave x-ray machine. If the TSA gives you any hassle, simply state that you are unable to use the x-ray machine due to medical reasons. They will call a supervisor and the supervisor will handle the situation. Do not pass through the scanner with an insulin pump or OpenAPS looping rig, as it could cause permanent damage to either device.

### Keep your Pump Attached
It may be tempting to run your insulin pump through the x-ray machine to save time. Don't do this. Even if it makes it through the process alive, you may still be taken to a secondary inspection room to answer questions about the strange electronic device in your bag that contains liquid. If this happens, they aren't going to give you your stuff back until you satisfy their questioning procedure, which could take... ~~forever~~ valuable time that you will be disconnected from your infusion device.

### The Explosives Swab
TSA is going to instruct you to go into the center of the screening area after your patdown. A TSA Agent will take a small cloth and wipe down your insulin pump (and/or OpenAPS looping rig if applicable). They will then take the cloth to a machine which checks for explosives residue. This is the only dangerous part of your trip, if they find that you were playing around with semtex, you're gonna have some 'splainin to do.

The trace detector will look something similar to this:

where they will place the cloth in the receptacle and the machine will check for traces of explosive material. As long as you haven't been messing with red phosphorus with Jesse Pinkman, you should come out with no issues.

## When Boarding
Make sure that when you board the plane, if they tell you that you must check your bag due to lack of space in the overhead bins... take your ziploc bag full of supplies and medications out and keep it with you. You don't want it going into the belly of the plane. Keep it with you at all times.

## On the Plane
Some flights can take nearly all day to complete, especially on the Airbus A380 or Boeing 747 planes that have massive fuel tanks and are meant for long haul flights. You may need to dose or take medication while on the plane, which is another reason you should have those supplies in your carryon bag with you at all times. Don't be afraid to shoot up insulin on the plane, especially if you are enjoying the *delicious* airline food.~1~

### For Insulin Pump Users
If you are using an insulin pump, please be aware that the pressure changes on the plane while ascending to--and descending fro--cruising altitude can create bubbles and/or cause more or less insulin than normal to be delivered during ascent and descent. If you use a pump with an insulin cartridge, the best thing to do while ascending is to suspend the pump until you reach the cruising altitude and the captain turns off the fasten seatbelts light. At this point, you can remove the cartridge to check for air bubbles, prime them out, and resume insulin delivery. When descending, you should disconnect the tubing and suspend. The descent can cause insulin in the pump and/or tubing to deliver into your body spontaneously, which leads to hypos when picking up your baggage (not a fun experience, especially if you reach your destination and none of the cinnabons are open.)
