Travel with Diabetes can be daunting at first. Making sure your bag is packed with all of the necessary equipment and medication is only the beginning of the adventure.

## Medications

Make sure to bring enough of the medication you need to last one-and-a-half to two times the length of your travel plans. It is difficult to get replacement supplies and medications when you are traveling abroad, so it is best to have extra stuff just in case.

All aboard! When traveling, make sure to pack your medications and supplies _in your carryon luggage_. It is the least likely article to get lost, and, if you have it in your checked baggage, and it gets lost... not a good start to your adventure, my friends.
