Travel with Diabetes can be daunting at first. Making sure your bag is packed with all of the necessary equipment and medication is only the beginning of the adventure.

## Packing your Supplies and Medications

Make sure to bring enough of the medication you need to last one-and-a-half to two times the length of your travel plans. It is difficult to get replacement supplies and medications when you are traveling abroad, so it is best to have extra stuff just in case.

When packing for your trip, you may be aware of the rule that all of your liquids must fit in one quart-sized ziplock bag. Fo travelers with medical conditions, you are allowed to bring another bag (or more if need be) to carry your medical liquids. They do not count towards your allotted one quart sized bag of liquids.

All aboard! When traveling, make sure to pack your medications and supplies _in your carryon luggage_. It is the least likely article to get lost, and, if you have it in your checked baggage, and it gets lost... not a good start to your adventure, my friends.

## When Boarding

Make sure that when you board the plane, if they tell you you must check your bag due to lack of space in the overhad bins... take your ziplock bag full of supplies out and keep it with you. You don't want it going into the belly of the plane. Keep it with you at all times.
