Travel with Diabetes can be daunting at first. Making sure your bag is packed with all of the necessary equipment and medication is only the beginning of the adventure.

## Packing your Supplies and Medications

Make sure to bring enough of the medication you need to last one-and-a-half to two times the length of your travel plans. It is difficult to get replacement supplies and medications when you are traveling abroad, so it is best to have extra stuff just in case.

When packing for your trip, you may be aware of the rule that all of your liquids must fit in one quart-sized ziplock bag. For travelers with medical conditions, you are allowed to bring another bag (or more if need be) to carry your medical liquids. They do not count towards your allotted one quart sized bag of liquids.

All aboard! When traveling, make sure to pack your medications and supplies _in your carryon luggage_. It is the least likely article to get lost, and, if you have it in your checked baggage, and it gets lost... not a good start to your adventure, my friends.

## The Security Line

The security line has many pitfalls you can avoid with the proper preparation. We will help out by giving a few tips that have helped us in the past.

### Medications
As stated above, your prescription liquids do not count against your 1 quart liquids limit, so keep them in a separate plastic bag. Place them in an xray scan bin next to your other bag full of liquids, deodorant, hairspray/gels, etc if you have one. Make sure your prescription medications have a prescription label with the medication name and your name on the side.

### Devices
TSA has specific procedures for people with medical devices. You are able to bypass the milimeter wave xray scanner, as well as keep any insulin pump, CGM, or omnipods attached while walking through the metal detector. All you need to do is state that you are a passenger with non-removable medical devices and wish to opt for a patdown instead of going into the millimeter wave x-ray machine. If the TSA gives you any hassle, simply state that you are unable to use the x-ray machine due to medical reasons. They will call a supervisor and the supervisor will handle the situation. Do not pass through the scanner with an insulin pump or OpenAPS looping rig, as it could cause permanent damage to either device.

### Keep your Pump Attached
It may be tempting to run your pump through the x-ray machine to save time. Don't do this. Even if it makes it through the process alive, you may still be taken to a secondary inspection room to answer questions about the strange eletronic device in your bag that contains liquid. If this happens, they aren't going to give you your stuff back until you satisfy their questioning procedure, which could take... valuable time that you will be disconnected from your infusion device.

### The Explosives Swab
TSA is going to instruct you to go into the center of the screening area after your patdown. A TSA Agent will take a small cloth and wipe down your insulin pump (and/or OpenAPS looping rig if applicable). They will then take the cloth to a machine which checks for explosives residue. This is the only dangerous part of your trip, if they find that you were messing with semtex, you're gonna have some 'splainin to do.

## When Boarding

Make sure that when you board the plane, if they tell you that you must check your bag due to lack of space in the overhead bins... take your ziplock bag full of supplies out and keep it with you. You don't want it going into the belly of the plane. Keep it with you at all times.
